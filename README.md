# Welcome to the Seattle Area Single Cell (SASC "sassy") User Group GitHub!

## About us
As more and more researchers use single cell molecular profiling techniques, there is an outstanding need for a local user group where people can discuss their experiences, exchange ideas, and foster support. The [Brotman Baty Institute (BBI)](https://brotmanbaty.org) is building upon previous efforts to establish user groups at individual institutes by kicking-off a Seattle Area Single Cell (SASC "sassy") user group that aims to serve members of our three partnering institutions: UW Medicine, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, and Seattle Children's. Researchers outside these institutions are also welcome to join. SASC will hold 2h quarterly meetings at rotating locations with the first hour being dedicated to tutorials or method-oriented talks, followed by a social hour to encourage discussion and build community amongst single cell researchers. Please add yourself to our email list if you would like to receive communications related to SASC!

All meeting slides, workshop scripts, and related materials are available right here in this GitHub repository. Feel free to explore, download, and reuse!


## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èWant to Lead? 
SASC thrives on collaborative learning! We welcome researchers who are interested in leading a session‚Äîwhether it's a tutorial, workflow demo, or group discussion. Topics should be technology-agnostic and broadly applicable to single-cell projects.

Interested? Reach out to us at sci-help@brotmanbaty.org.


## ü§ù Want to sponsor? 
We invite industry partners and innovators to support the Seattle Area Single-Cell User Group meetings -- a quarterly workshop series that brings together researchers, analysts, and technologists working on single-cell related projects across the Seatle area. 

Sponsorship is non-recurring and flexible, as we rotate partners each quarter. Your support helps us foster an open and collaborative space for sharing ideas, workflows, and advances in single-cell genomics.

Interested in sponsoring an upcoming session? We'd love to hear from you!


## üéâ Thanks for Stopping By
We‚Äôre excited to continue building a collaborative and supportive single-cell community in Seattle. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, there's a place for you at SASC. We welcome your ideas, questions, and participation‚Äîsee you at the next meeting!
